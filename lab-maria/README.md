Use your terminal to chat with others on your network (or just yourself which is probably what you're going to do).

***
##TO USE:

* clone this repository and ``cd`` into it
* run ``npm i``
* in another terminal, run ``telnet localhost 3000``

A list of commands will appear:

``@all`` MESSAGE (send a message to all online users)
``@nick`` USERNAME (change your username)
``@dm`` USERNAME (send a direct message to someone else)
``@channel`` (list all other online users)

* start talking to yourself!

For linux users, close out of the telnet connection by
[``ctrl``] + [``]``] and type 'close'
