# TCP Chat Server
### This is a simple TCP chat server I created that allows you to talk to other user when you log in.

#### Here are the commands to use the chat:

##### /all
* Lets a user message everyone in the chat: /all hello

##### /nick
* Lets a user change their nickname: /nick Carlo

##### /dm
* Lets a user message one person by nickname in the chat: /dm Carlo hello
