# About this project

So for this project we had to create a basic chatroom by using localhost and telnet. The server.js took all the commands and inputted them into your code to then send it to the other folks on the chat.

#How to run the server:
1.Start command prompt,
2.Input npm server.js

#How to run the chatroom:
1.On a seperate command prompt input telnet localhost 8080
2.Start chatting with people!
