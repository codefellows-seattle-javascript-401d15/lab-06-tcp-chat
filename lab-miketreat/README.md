To launch the program, 

1. Open up two terminal windows.
2. In one window, navigate to the dir lab-miketreat and type in ```npm i```
3. Once that is done, type in ```nodemon server.js``` This will launch the server for you on your local machine.
4. Now, in the other terminal window type ``` telnet localhost 3000 ```


After that you'll be inside the program! As long as the server is running the tcp chat will run.




If you want other people to connect to you then send them your IP address and have them open a terminal 
Then they just need to follow step 4, but substitue 'localhost 3000' with the IP address you gave them!


Once you enter the chat a greeting message will show up and a help menu.

If you want to play around with it you can open up as many terminal windows as you want and if you follow step 4 for
each terminal you can mimic multiple users!
